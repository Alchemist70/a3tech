  "subtitle": "A Retrieval-Augmented LLM-Guided GNN for Mechanistic, Interpretable Biomarker Discovery",
  "description": "Trustworthy biomarker discovery from multi-omics requires models that are both accurate and mechanistically interpretable. This project presents a Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model guided Graph Neural Network (RAG-LLM-GNN) for explainable multi-omics biomarker discovery, integrating heterogeneous omics data with curated molecular knowledge to yield sparse, pathway-consistent panels and causal-style rationales.",
  "detailedDescription": "The approach constructs a molecular interaction graph from public resources (e.g., STRING, Reactome, KEGG) and encodes multi-omics signals via a modality-aware GNN. A biomedical LLM, coupled with targeted retrieval from pathway databases and literature, injects mechanistic priors by shaping the objective with pathway-sparsity and evidence-alignment constraints, and by masking implausible interactions during training. The method includes a counterfactual auditing module to simulate perturbations and validate mechanistic rationales.",
