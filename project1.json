  "description": "A comprehensive federated learning methodology that enables collaborative model training across healthcare institutions while preserving patient privacy and addressing data heterogeneity challenges.",
  "detailedDescription": "This research introduces the Adaptive Personalized Federated Learning with Online Domain Alignment (APFL-ODA) framework, designed specifically for distributed multi-modal medical datasets. The system integrates advanced techniques including adaptive personalization mechanisms, online domain alignment, privacy-preserving mechanisms, and communication efficiency optimizations to overcome the pervasive challenges of Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data across healthcare institutions.",

      "methodology": "The APFL-ODA framework combines multiple advanced techniques: adaptive personalization mechanisms (FedProx, SCAFFOLD, pFedMe, meta-learning), online domain alignment techniques (federated adversarial training, contrastive learning), privacy-preserving mechanisms (differential privacy with DP-SGD, secure aggregation protocols), and communication efficiency optimizations (Top-K compression, quantization, PowerSGD with error feedback).",
      "technicalApproach": "The system constructs a molecular interaction graph from public resources and encodes multi-omics signals via a modality-aware GNN. A biomedical LLM injects mechanistic priors through loss shaping and structure masking, promoting pathway-consistent sparsity and evidence alignment.",
