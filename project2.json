  "description": "A comprehensive security and interaction framework for Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) integrating facial recognition, gesture-based controls, and voice command interfaces for continuous driver authentication and hands-free operation.",
  "detailedDescription": "This project presents a security architecture for SDVs that continuously validates driver identity using multimodal biometrics, preventing unauthorized access at any stage. The system includes a MySQL-driven OTP module for temporary access, detailed access logs, and automatic alerts for suspicious activity. Implemented in Python with OpenCV, Face Recognition, and Speech Recognition, the prototype demonstrates practical security and usability for intelligent transportation systems.",
